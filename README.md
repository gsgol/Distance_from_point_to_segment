# A program that calculates the distance from a point to a segment in 2D space also the second part of the program calculates the distance from a point to a polygon.

## The program uses this formula to calculate the distance:

## When calculating the distance from a point to a polygon, program calculates distance to the all sides and then choses the minimum distance.
